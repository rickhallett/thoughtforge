Explanation of Design Decisions

1. OriginalSource Model

	•	Purpose: Stores the original input content along with any initial metadata and query parameters.
	•	Fields:
	•	sourceType: To differentiate between different input types in the future (e.g., ‘markdown’, ‘web_clipping’, ‘voice_note’).
	•	content: Stores the raw content.
	•	queryParams and metadata: Stored as JSON to accommodate varying data without schema changes.
	•	Future Extensions: Adding new input types or metadata doesn’t require schema changes; you can store additional data in metadata.

2. Content Model

	•	Purpose: Represents the content at various stages of processing.
	•	Fields:
	•	currentStatus: Tracks the overall status of the content.
	•	metadata: Stores AI outputs or other processing results.
	•	Relations:
	•	processingLogs: Logs each processing step, allowing you to track the content’s journey without altering the Content schema.
	•	publishingQueues: Manages scheduling and publishing without modifying the Content model.
	•	tags: Uses a join table ContentTag for a many-to-many relationship with Tag, accommodating future tagging needs.

3. ProcessingLog Model

	•	Purpose: Records each processing stage’s details, status, and any outputs.
	•	Fields:
	•	stage: Enum representing the processing stage.
	•	details: JSON field to store outputs like AI-enhanced content, SEO metrics, etc.
	•	Relations:
	•	Linked to Content and ErrorLog for comprehensive tracking.
	•	Future Extensions:
	•	Adding new processing stages is as simple as adding a new value to the ProcessingStage enum.
	•	The details field can store varying data without schema changes.

4. PublishingQueue Model

	•	Purpose: Manages the scheduling and publishing of content.
	•	Fields:
	•	scheduledAt: When the content is intended to be published.
	•	actualPublishedAt: Records the actual publish time.
	•	metadata: Stores publishing results or additional info.
	•	Relations:
	•	destinations: A many-to-many relationship with PublishingDestination through QueueDestination.
	•	Future Extensions:
	•	Supports custom delivery schedules and multi-channel publishing.

5. PublishingDestination Model

	•	Purpose: Stores information about where content can be published.
	•	Fields:
	•	type: Enum to categorize the destination.
	•	config: JSON field to securely store credentials or connection details.
	•	Future Extensions:
	•	Adding new destination types or configurations doesn’t require schema changes.

6. ErrorLog Model

	•	Purpose: Captures errors occurring at any stage of processing or publishing.
	•	Fields:
	•	metadata: Can store additional error details, stack traces, etc.
	•	Relations:
	•	Linked to Content, ProcessingLog, and PublishingQueue to provide context.
	•	Future Extensions:
	•	Can accommodate more detailed error information without schema changes.

7. Tag and ContentTag Models

	•	Purpose: Manages tagging of content for searchability and organization.
	•	Design:
	•	Uses a join table ContentTag for a many-to-many relationship, which is standard and scalable.
	•	Future Extensions:
	•	Adding more tags or associating content with multiple tags is straightforward.

8. User Model

	•	Purpose: Manages user information, particularly for the approval stage.
	•	Fields:
	•	role: Enum to handle different levels of access (e.g., ADMIN, EDITOR, USER).
	•	Relations:
	•	approvals: Tracks which contents a user has approved.
	•	Future Extensions:
	•	Additional roles or permissions can be added via the UserRole enum.

Design Principles Applied

	1.	Scalability and Extensibility:
	•	JSON Fields: Used in several models (e.g., queryParams, metadata, details) to store flexible data without requiring schema changes.
	•	Enums: Enums like ProcessingStage, ContentStatus, and DestinationType can be extended by adding new values.
	•	Relations: Designed with clear relations to enable easy addition of new models or relations in the future.
	2.	Separation of Concerns:
	•	Processing Logs: Separates processing steps from the Content model, making it easier to track and manage each stage independently.
	•	Error Logs: Centralized error logging with relations to relevant models for better traceability.
	•	Publishing Mechanism: The PublishingQueue and PublishingDestination models manage scheduling and publishing separately from content processing.
	3.	Normalization:
	•	Tags: Implemented as a separate model with a join table to avoid data duplication and maintain data integrity.
	•	Destinations: Abstracted into their own model to allow for multiple publishing channels and configurations.
	4.	Future-Proofing:
	•	Source Types: The sourceType field in OriginalSource prepares for future input types like web clippings or voice notes.
	•	Processing Stages: The use of enums and logs allows for new stages to be added with minimal changes.
	•	User Roles: Enums and relations are set up to easily expand user capabilities and permissions.
	5.	Security and Privacy:
	•	Credentials: Stored in the config field of PublishingDestination, which should be encrypted or handled securely.
	•	Data Integrity: Foreign keys and relation constraints ensure data consistency across models.

How This Design Facilitates Future Extensions

	•	Adding New Input Types: Simply add new sourceType values and handle them in your application logic; the database schema remains unaffected.
	•	Introducing New Processing Stages: Add new values to the ProcessingStage enum and implement the corresponding logic; the ProcessingLog model already accommodates this.
	•	Supporting Multimedia Content: Extend the OriginalSource and Content models to include file references or additional metadata in the metadata JSON field.
	•	Integrating Additional LLMs or AI Services: Use the ProcessingLog’s details field to store outputs from different AI services.
	•	Expanding Publishing Channels: Add new entries to the PublishingDestination model with appropriate configurations.
	•	Enhancing User Roles and Permissions: Extend the UserRole enum and adjust application logic accordingly.

Next Steps

	•	Implement Migration Scripts: Use Prisma Migrate to set up your database schema based on these models.
	•	Develop Application Logic: Build out the API endpoints and business logic to interact with these models.
	•	Secure Sensitive Data: Ensure that fields like password and config are handled securely, using encryption and environment variables where appropriate.
	•	Testing: Write unit and integration tests for your models and application logic to ensure reliability.
	•	Documentation: Keep your schema and design decisions well-documented for future reference and onboarding.

Conclusion

This database schema provides a robust foundation for your content pipeline project, meeting your initial requirements while being flexible enough to accommodate future expansions. By carefully considering relationships, data types, and potential future needs, we’ve created a design that minimizes the need for heavy migrations down the line.
